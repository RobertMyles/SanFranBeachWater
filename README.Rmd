# SanFranBeachWater

`SanFranBeachWater` is a little R package that downloads the Beach Water Quality Monitoring Program data that the the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission maintain [here](http://sfwater.org/cfapps/lims/beachmain1.cfm). The data can be downloaded in raw form, or tables for individual beaches can be downloaded. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("RobertMyles/SanFranBeachWater")
```

## Usage  

Get the data for China Beach:  

```{r}
library(SanFranBeachWater)

san_fran_china_beach()

```

`r emo::ji("poop")`

Or alternatively, just get the status of the beach ("Open" or "Closed"): 

```{r}
san_fran_windsurfer_circle(status = TRUE)
```

Sweet! `r emo::ji("beach_umbrella")`
